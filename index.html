        Hello, this website is currently under construction. Unfortunately I am not<br>
        much of a web developer these days, and I am not quite sure when I will get<br>
        the time to finish it. In the meantime however, I would like to leave you<br>
        with this quote:<br><br>

        "The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is the<br>
        lawgiver. No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful,<br>
        has ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or field of <br>
        battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops." - Joseph Weizenbaum
